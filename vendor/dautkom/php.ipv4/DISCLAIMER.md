# History

It has been a while, since the original library was developed. However, some serious architectural issues were found and it was decided to perform full refactoring. As a benefit, there were added normal composer support without obsolete dependencies and project is fully covered with tests.
  
# Disclaimers

**PHP**
All latest libraries by me and my company are developed for PHP 7 and higher. Why? To keep the progress going. It is possible to cut out all type hinting and release library for previous PHP version, but I had enough of fighting with outdated software and backward compatibility in adjacent domains. 
Also the major update to 1.0 version has broken some backward compatibility to previous versions. Sorry about that. But it was considered necessary to perform methods unification and general clean-up.

**Github**
Most projects now are moved to Bitbucket due to it's loyal policies about private repos. Main development streamline is hidden and only side-projects go public. Like this one, php.netsnmp, php.docsis and others. It's easier to manage all projects under one web VCS.
